The code for this crate is temporarily vendored from
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-rs with minor modifications in order to get the
Python interface working. Any changes made here will later be integrated
upstream at which point this vendored code will get removed.

In the future, once `qiskit-rs` reaches feature parity and stability, we expect
to replace the `qiskit-sys` dependencies in this workspace with `qiskit-rs`.
