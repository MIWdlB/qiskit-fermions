.. currentmodule:: qiskit_fermions.operators.library

Building on top of the operator representations provided by :mod:`~qiskit_fermions.operators`, this
module provides various tools to simplify the construction of commonly used operators.

Commutator Generators
---------------------

Operator classes can implement the :class:`.SupportsCommutators` :py:class:`~typing.Protocol`, which
allows them to be used with the functions listed in the table below, to quickly compute multiple
commutator variants.

   :toctree: ../stubs/

   SupportsCommutators
   commutator
   anti_commutator
   double_commutator

Common Operators
----------------

Various common operators can easily be generated from constructor methods.
This section provides an overview of these methods for a quick reference, grouped by category.

Electronic Integrals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The constructor methods listed here generally take the coefficients of electronic structure
Hamiltonians as an input. Different flavors exist:

* ``tril``: these methods consume 1-dimensional arrays of flattened (generalized) triangular indices
* ``full``: these methods consume high-dimensional arrays
* ``spin``: these methods take separate arrays for the different spin species
* ``sym``: these methods take a single array for one spin species and infer the other spin species

* 1-Body Terms

.. table::

   ================================================= ===========================================================
   :meth:`.FermionOperator.from_1body_tril_spin_sym` Constructs from spin-symmetric triangular 1-body integrals.
   :meth:`.FermionOperator.from_1body_tril_spin`     Constructs from separate spin triangular 1-body integrals.
   ================================================= ===========================================================

* 2-Body Terms

.. table::

   ================================================= ===========================================================
   :meth:`.FermionOperator.from_2body_tril_spin_sym` Constructs from spin-symmetric triangular 2-body integrals.
   :meth:`.FermionOperator.from_2body_tril_spin`     Constructs from separate spin triangular 2-body integrals.
