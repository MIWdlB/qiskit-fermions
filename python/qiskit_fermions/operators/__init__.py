Operator Representations

.. currentmodule:: qiskit_fermions.operators

This module provides various data structures for representing fermionic operators in different
bases.

Fermion Operator
----------------

This operator represents fermionic operators in terms of the second-quantization creation and
annihilation operators.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../stubs/

   FermionAction
   FermionOperator
   cre
   ann

Majorana Operator
-----------------

This operator represents fermionic operators in terms of Majorana fermions.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../stubs/

   MajoranaAction
   MajoranaOperator
   gamma
