.. warning::
   This package is under active development!
   If you have feedback, please `open an issue <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-fermions/issues/new/choose>`_.

This package extends Qiskit with tools for working on fermionic systems.
It follows a similar design philosophy as Qiskit itself:

- the core functionality is written in Rust
- first-party language bindings are provided for both, Python and C
- the APIs are designed to "feel" similar to Qiskit

The scope of this package includes the following functionality:

- several operator data structures
- a framework to develop operator conversion methods
- a library of common operator converters
- a framework to develop quantum circuit synthesis methods
- a library of common quantum circuit synthesizers
